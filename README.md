## About
Improve horses by removing stupid stuff and adding useful stuff.

### Server Changes:
<details>
  <summary>Horses Sit in Rafts</summary>

  Rafts only because its impossible to break boats when they are in a boat. Works with horses, donkeys, mules, zombie horses, skeleton horses, camels and llamas.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Fix rubber banding on stairs/slabs "Horse moved wrongly!"
    <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-100830">(MC-100830)</a>
  </summary>

  ![side by side comparison of going up a staircase with/without the mod. The without frequently goes back a couple of steps in a disorienting manner. The with doesn't have that and results in travel being faster](https://i.imgur.com/bXu7lt4.gif)
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Saddled Horses don't wander</summary>

  ![horse standing in place with a saddle on, extremely sped up](https://i.imgur.com/E0ZGzMU.gif)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Remove break speed debuff</summary>

  Normally being mounted on a horse makes you mine at 1/5 the speed.
  Now you can actually do stuff on horseback

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Improve "Step Height" capability</summary>

  Increases horse step-height from 1 block to 1.1 blocks.\
  This makes riding horses around path blocks way less frustrating.

</details>

### Client Changes:
<details>
  <summary>Allow swimming while Mounted</summary>

  Normally Horses will sink in water when you are riding them.
  This makes you float on the surface as if they weren't mounted.
  The default config turns this ability off for undead horses and camels.

</details>

<details>
  <summary> Prevent "Bucking" </summary>

  Normally horses will randomly "Buck", stopping dead in their tracks while you are riding them.
  This prevents them from doing that.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Fade Horse as you look down</summary>

  The same applies to donkeys, mules, zombie horses, skeleton horses, camels and llamas.

  ![going down a hill into a cave, looking down through horse for better navigation](https://i.imgur.com/kwtmFVd.gif)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Horse Head Pitch offset</summary>

  Option to lower horse's head down up to 45 degrees to improve visibility.
  Works with horses, donkeys, mules, zombie horses and skeleton horses.

  ![comparison of 0 vs 45 degree offset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37855219/163890939-87f3b255-176a-49df-ad4d-ec5b41a3b54a.png)
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Horses named `jeb_` become rainbow</summary>

  The same can be applied to donkeys, mules, camels, llamas, zombie horses and skeleton horses.

<details>
  <summary>Hotkey to open survival inventory</summary>

  ![image](https://i.imgur.com/8oOswAR.png)
  * Pre 1.20.2
    * Horse Buff pulls from your Minecraft keybinds, so if you change your inventory/sprint key, that will change what you need to press to access your survival inventory
  * Post 1.20.2
    * A keybind for opening your inventory while on a horse has been added. ALT + Inv (ALT + E) is now the default, but you can change it to whatever you like
</details>
